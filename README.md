## Project Description:
This project is a creative virtual game where players can grow unique plants by minting NFTs. By watering the plant within a specified time frame, players nurture its growth. Failure to water the plant in time will cause it to wither. After two waterings, the plant will utilize Chainlink's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to randomly bloom, rewarding players with a distinctive blooming plant NFT.

Potential Future Enhancements:

1.Extend the watering interval to provide a more realistic growth experience.

2.Implement thorough and comprehensive testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the system.

3.Create a user-friendly frontend interface that allows players to easily water their plants and view the status of their NFTs. Additionally, develop a dedicated marketplace where players can trade their blooming plants, fostering a vibrant community and enhancing the overall gaming experience.
